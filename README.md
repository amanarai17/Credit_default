<h1> Predicting The Probability of Credit Card Default using Machine Learning</h1>
<br><br>

![GitHub Logo](/credit.jpg)

<h2>Overview</h2>


<p> Using supervised learning to train a model with credit default data to determine the probability and/or classification (“default” vs “non-default”) of the user’s liability. Creating a UI that will take user input, such as, such as education level, sex, marital status, payment history and income.
Our machine learning project produced some predictive analytic techniques such as a credit defaulting model, which can often be employed by banks and lending institutions to understand and manage the risk of their loans and lending portfolios. </p>
<br><br>

<h2>Goals/Outcome</h2>
<ul> 
  <li> Determining probability of user liability </li>
  <li> Creating an interactive UI that will take users input </li>
  <li> To determine if a neural network vs logistic regression is the better model for either </li>
</ul>
